# Happiness-Data-Set-Exploration
In depth analysis of the happiness data set, which can be found at this link: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1PcCyXXs28wvhAcatjBqa48hf9JD8_Xqa/view
This exploratory data analysis was completed for one of my classes, DSC-207R Python for Data Science, for my online masters of data science degree at UCSD. 
This juypter notebook explores a dataset that contains a list of countries, their associated happiness rank, and also a list of features for each country. Exploration was done on this dataset to see trends, visualizations, and analysis of important features in the happiness rank.
